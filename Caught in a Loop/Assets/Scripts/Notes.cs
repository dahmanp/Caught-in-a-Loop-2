    //TO DO

    //Game Aspects:
    // - Teams - Marenox and Aptiostell
    // - Maybe you can choose your type? Healing or offense
    //           - For Healing, two Options:
    //                1. If playerid %2 = 0, bullets heal. Otherwise they do smaller damage
    //                2. Can create rings of healing for players on their team
    //                3. HARDER: select a player to heal, shows all player health
    // - ADD MUSIC THIS TIME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
}
// new enum for xray, in playercontroller
